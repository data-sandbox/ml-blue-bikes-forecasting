# Machine Learning and Boston's Bluebikes Program
This project aims to use machine learning (ML) to create a ridership time series forecasting model, an online learning model, and an outlier / anomaly detection analysis. The [Bluebikes](https://www.bluebikes.com/system-data) program publishes trip history data every quarter. Additional weather-related features (obtained from [NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/)) are also incorporated into the model.

The notebooks in this repo are organized based on the model or analysis developed:
- [ML Time Series Forecasting Model](https://github.com/data-sandbox/ml-bluebikes-forecasting/blob/main/01-Forecasting-ML-model.ipynb) - This notebook builds a machine learning model to predict daily ridership demand. This time series model is generated by modeling signal drift, seasonality, and residual noise.
- [Online Learning Model](https://github.com/data-sandbox/ml-bluebikes-forecasting/blob/main/02-Online-learning-model.ipynb) - Here we develop an online learning algorithm that is able to analyze incoming data in real time and learn from this future data, enabling continuous maintenance of the model.
- [Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/data-sandbox/ml-bluebikes-forecasting/blob/main/03-Anomaly-detection.ipynb) - This model takes the previously developed model and performs anomaly detection to identify outlier days in ridership demand and explore possible explanations.
